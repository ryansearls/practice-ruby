# 1. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string concatenation (the + operator).

# first_name = "ryan"
# last_name = "searls"

# p first_name + " " + last_name

# 2. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# first_name = "ryan"
# last_name = "searls"

# puts "my first name is #{first_name} and my last name is #{last_name}"

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to input a word. If the word is "marco", print "polo".

# word = gets.chomp
# if word == "marco"
#   p "polo"
# end

# 4. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string concatenation (the + operator).

color1 = "red"
color2 = "blue"
color3 = "green"
