# Write a function that prints out every number from 1 to N, with the following exceptions:

# If the number is divisible by 3, print out "FIZZ".
# If the number is divisible by 5, print out "BUZZ".
# If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print out "FIZZBUZZ".


# def fizzbuzz(n)
#   index = 1
#   while index <= n
#     if index % 3 == 0 && index % 5 == 0
#       puts "FIZZBUZZ"
#     elsif 
#       index % 5 == 0
#       puts "BUZZ"
#     elsif 
#       index % 3 == 0
#       puts "FIZZ"
#     else 
#       puts "#{index}"
#     end 
#     index += 1
