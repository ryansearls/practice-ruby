# Write a function that gives the Nth number of the Fibonacci Sequence. The Fibonacci sequence begins with 0 and 1, and every number thereafter is the sum of the previous two numbers. So the sequence goes like this:

# 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, and so on until infinity...

# Input: 9
# Output: 21 (as this is the 9th number of the Fibonacci Sequence)

# Given a year, report if it is a leap year.

# The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:

# on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
# except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
# unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400
# For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is. 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.

# If your language provides a method in the standard library that does this look-up, pretend it doesnt exist and implement it yourself.

# The Collatz Conjecture or 3x+1 problem can be summarized as follows:

# Take any positive integer n. If n is even, divide n by 2 to get n / 2. If n is odd, multiply n by 3 and add 1 to get 3n + 1. Repeat the process indefinitely. The conjecture states that no matter which number you start with, you will always reach 1 eventually.

# Given a number n, return the number of steps required to reach 1.

# Examples
# Starting with n = 12, the steps would be as follows:

# 12
# 6
# 3
# 10
# 5
# 16
# 8
# 4
# 2
# 1

# Resulting in 9 steps. So for input n = 12, the return value would be 9.


# def collatz(num)
#   steps = 0
#   while true
#     if num % 2 == 0
#       num = num / 2
#       steps += 1
#     elsif num % 2 == 1
#       num = (num * 3) + 1
#       steps += 1
#     elsif num == 1
#       p num
#       steps += 1
#       break
#     end 
#   end 
#   return steps      
# end 


# p collatz(12) #9

#does not work


# def collatz(n)
#   steps = 0

#   while (n != 1)
#     if n % 2 == 0
#       n = n / 2 
#     else 
#       n = (n * 3) + 1
#     end
#     steps += 1
#   end
