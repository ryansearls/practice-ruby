# Write a function that gives the Nth number of the Fibonacci Sequence. The Fibonacci sequence begins with 0 and 1, and every number thereafter is the sum of the previous two numbers. So the sequence goes like this:

# 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, and so on until infinity...

# Input: 9
# Output: 21 (as this is the 9th number of the Fibonacci Sequence)


# def fibonacci(number)
#   num1, num2 = [0,1]

#   (number - 1).times do
#     num1, num2 = num2, num1 + num2
#   end

# Given a year, report if it is a leap year.

# The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:

# on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
# except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
# unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400
# For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is. 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.

# If your language provides a method in the standard library that does this look-up, pretend it doesn't exist and implement it yourself.

# def leap_year(year)

# If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

# The Collatz Conjecture or 3x+1 problem can be summarized as follows:

# Take any positive integer n. If n is even, divide n by 2 to get n / 2. If n is odd, multiply n by 3 and add 1 to get 3n + 1. Repeat the process indefinitely. The conjecture states that no matter which number you start with, you will always reach 1 eventually.

# Given a number n, return the number of steps required to reach 1.

# Examples
# Starting with n = 12, the steps would be as follows:

# 12
# 6
# 3
# 10
# 5
# 16
# 8
# 4
# 2
# 1

# Resulting in 9 steps. So for input n = 12, the return value would be 9.


# def collatz(number)
#   steps = 0
#   while number != 1
#     if number % 2 == 0
#       number = number / 2
#     elsif number % 2 == 1
#       number = number * 3 + 1
#     end
#     steps += 1
#   end     
#   steps

# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
